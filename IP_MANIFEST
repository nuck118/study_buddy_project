PROPRIETARY FEATURE SPECIFICATION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DECLARATION

PROJECT: Study Buddy
OWNER: Golden Kalala
DATE: 2026
STATUS: PROPRIETARY & CONFIDENTIAL

1. DECLARATION OF OWNERSHIP
Golden Kalala (the "Inventor") hereby asserts exclusive ownership over the novel 
methods, logic flows, system architectures, and feature implementations described 
herein (collectively, the "Invention"). The specific combination of gamified 
learning management, real-time activity tracking, and interactive code verification 
constitutes a proprietary system protected under International Intellectual Property laws.

2. PROTECTED FEATURE CLAIMS
The following features are claimed as exclusive Intellectual Property of the Inventor. 
Any replication of the logic, visual layout, or backend mechanics of these features 
is strictly prohibited.

   A. THE GAMIFIED LEARNING PROGRESSION ENGINE
   --------------------------------------------------------
   A proprietary system linking 'Goals' to 'UserProgress' via a specialized backend 
   logic that prevents duplicate scoring and ensures linear progression.
   - Claim 1: The method of checking `UserProgress` existence prior to awarding XP.
   - Claim 2: The automated leaderboard ranking algorithm based on accumulated XP (`total_score`).
   - Claim 3: The dynamic unlocking of course sections based on goal completion states.

   B. INTERACTIVE BROWSER-BASED CODE LAB
   --------------------------------------------------------
   A novel implementation of a coding environment that validates user input against 
   server-side logic without external compilers.
   - Claim 1: The 'PracticalChallenge' model structure containing instruction, 
     starter code, and hidden validation text.
   - Claim 2: The real-time preview mechanism injecting user HTML/CSS/JS into a 
     sandboxed iframe.
   - Claim 3: The text-based validation algorithm used to verify code correctness 
     for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL syntax.

   C. ADAPTIVE CHRONOLOGICAL JOURNAL SYSTEM
   --------------------------------------------------------
   A productivity tracking system featuring a "Timeline" visualization with 
   real-time status updates.
   - Claim 1: The continuous vertical timeline interface grouping entries by Date 
     headers (`{% regroup %}` logic) while maintaining Time sorting.
   - Claim 2: The JavaScript-based "Realtime Progress Algorithm" that calculates 
     percentage completion based on current server time versus defined Start/End timestamps.
   - Claim 3: The visual state engine that automatically transitions UI elements 
     from "Scheduled" (Gray) to "In Progress" (Pulsing Indigo) to "Completed" (Green).

   D. SECURE CONTENT DELIVERY & PROCTORING WRAPPERS
   --------------------------------------------------------
   Methods for delivering third-party educational content within a secure, 
   distraction-free modal environment.
   - Claim 1: The `getYouTubeEmbed` regex algorithm that sanitizes and secures 
     video links, forcing strict origin policies to prevent errors.
   - Claim 2: The PDF Enclosure method using Google Viewer encapsulation to bypass 
     `X-Frame-Options` security blocks, allowing external PDFs to render internally.

   E. DYNAMIC CERTIFICATION GENERATION ENGINE
   --------------------------------------------------------
   An automated system for verifying comprehensive course mastery and generating 
   cryptographically unique proofs of completion.
   - Claim 1: The `check_course_completion` logic that validates total goals versus 
     completed user goals before triggering issuance.
   - Claim 2: The programmatic image generation method (using Pillow) that 
     dynamically renders User Name, Subject, and Date onto a template canvas.
   - Claim 3: The assignment of Unique Identifiers (UUIDs) to certificates for 
     verification purposes.

3. VISUAL TRADE DRESS
The specific visual arrangement, color palette (Indigo/Gray/White "Enterprise Fun"), 
and UX patterns (Hover-lift cards, Modal interactions, Split-screen labs) constitute 
the unique "Trade Dress" of the application and may not be imitated to create 
consumer confusion.

4. NON-COMPETE NOTICE
Access to the source code of Study Buddy does not grant the viewer rights to build 
a competing Learning Management System (LMS) utilizing these specific feature 
implementations or database structures.

Signed and Sealed,
Golden Kalala
